# Techdegree-Project-2
 Mobile-first Responsive Layout Project. Using floats as opposed to flexbox to stay in line with course 2 curriculum. Adjustment was made to the footer and the associated border since an additional "Skills" section was added. I alternated the background colors and having the border with some sort of margin didn't look quite right. If you feel this should be adjusted to make sure I hit the "exceeds expectations" mark please let me know. Thank you!
